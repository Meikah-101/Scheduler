How to Use (Only compatible with python 3.7 +) 
Create a csv file with 2 columns(dates being in the right column and names in the left column), leave some rows in the names column absent  
Create a text file with a list of names seperated by commas in the same line (no new lines)
to ensure succcess the amount of names in the text file should be equal to the amount of dates in the csv 
open visual studio or terminal and run sch_csv_writer.py
code will prompt you to enter both the cvs file and text file you created, do so
after code is ran a new file called "new_sch.csv" will appear containing a new schedule with the names that were originally absent from the csv file
Enjoy !
