How to Use (Only compatible with python 3.7 +) 
Create a csv file with dates in the right column and names in the left column 
Create a text file with a list of names seperated by commas in the same line (no new lines)
to ensure succcess leave up to the ammount of names listed in the text file blank in the names column of the csv 
open visual studio or terminal and run sch_csv_writer.py
code will prompt you to enter both the cvs file and text file you created, do so
after code is ran a new file called "new_sch.csv" will appear containing a new schedule with the names that were originally absent from the csv file
Enjoy !
