How to Use (Only compatible with python 3.7 +) 
- Create a csv file with 2 columns , leave some rows in the names column absent 
  - dates must be in the right left column with the header labeled as "dates"
  - names must be in the right column with a header labeled as "names"
- Create a text file with a list of names seperated by commas in the same line (no new lines)
  - To ensure succcess the amount of names in the text file should be equal to the amount of dates in the csv
 - Note ( Both the csv and text fil must be in the same folder in order to work ) 
- Open visual studio or terminal and run "sch_csv_writer.py"
- The code will prompt you to enter both the csv file and text file you created, do so
- After code is ran a new file labeled "new_sch.csv" will appear containing a new schedule with the names that were originally absent from the csv file
Enjoy !
